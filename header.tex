\section{Introduction}

Since our debut in the Robocup arena in 2018, NAMeC has participated in three competitions : Montreal, Sydney and Bordeaux.
As we set our sights on the forthcoming 2024 RoboCup event in Eindhoven, this year's Team Description Paper (TDP) underscores our commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
We are making an incremental upgrade to our hardware and electronics system before a major overhaul scheduled for next year. Simultaneously, we are are rewriting our embedded system entirely in Rust to enhance performance, reliability and safety. In software development, we are focusing on the primary challenge faced by our team : debugging and visualization within our CRAbE framework.

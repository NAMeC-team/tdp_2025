\subsection{Hardware-based FOC control solution}
In the current generation of the robot (TODO:cite tdp), each motor card 
is controlled by a programmed STM32 processor, which implements the
Field-Oriented Control algorithm for motor control. The local velocity
command given to the robot is converted into 4 target velocities for each wheel.

This year, the team is experimenting the use of the Trinamic TMC4671
% todo: should we really talk about it ? no results yet
% i think not

\subsection{Receiving feedback from robots}

The team currently uses the nRF24L01+ radio module to communicate with the robots.
Up until now, command sending was single way, we didn't receive feedback from the robots.
This year, we use the payload ACK capability of the radio module. Each time a command is sent
to a robot, it responds with an acknowledgement packet to confirm reception.
The radio module allows us to put a 32 bytes of data inside the ACK packet,
thus enabling full-duplex communication, allowing us to receive ball detection data
and motor speeds.

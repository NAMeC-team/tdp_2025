\section{Firmware improvements}
Last year, most of our firmware had been rewritten in Rust.
The last part missing is code for motor control.
As the team is discussing whether to use a Rust-only communication protocol,
having a stable version written in C++ is the current objective until the Rust version
is ready for a full transition. By doing this, it will be beneficial
to perform comparisons between the two firmwares, and leaves us with a stable
solution if the Rust version were to have problems.
